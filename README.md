# Custom-Hydrometer
A custom hydrometer for my Bambu Labs AMS
The screen displays the humidity in big numbers in a percentage with the temperature underneath.
There is an indicator led that changes color from green to yellow to red so you know when it is time to change your decassaint.

Uses a RPi Pico dht11, SSD1306, HW-478, and a button
you may also want 220 ohm resistors for the led, and a psu (I use a HW-131)
